    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>Questions 1-5:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Define internet backbone in your own words</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The internet backbone is like the main core of the internet, it is high speed network infrastructure
                that forms the backbone of the world wide web. Its like how the ISPs connect and deliver data.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>2. What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Clients are like the user PC that is operated by someone, servers are automatic protocols that handle
                things like APIs, storage, etc. Clients: the front end thats receiving everything, Servers: the backend
                that needs to run fast and securely</li>
        </ul>

        <li>3. Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of
            the internet.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Servers store and give data / services, routers direct data between networks, switches connect devices that are in a network, workstations are the user devices / personal computers that access the internet, they all work together to allow for communication and data exchange on the internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>4. Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this
            protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The TCP/IP model is a set of protocols that break data into packets, route them across networks, and ensure reliable delivery, enabling clients and servers to communicate effectively over the internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>5. List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Email uses the internet, web browsing, and online gaming (things like servers for the games).</li>
        </ul>

        

    </ul>

<p>Questions 6-10:</p>
<ul>
    <li>6. What is hypertext?</li>
    <ul><li>Hypertext is a software system that allows linking between sections of text and associated material</li></ul>

    <li>7. How is “the web” related to the internet?</li>
    <ul><li>The web is the infrastructure to share web pages by using HTTP and borwsers, the internet is the hardware of everything and the web is a specific protocol on top of it for web pages.</li></ul>

    <li>8. Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</li>
    <ul><li>HTTP transfers data through clients and servers using a request-response model where the client sends a message to the server first and then the server sends back a response which contains the data the client requested.</li></ul>

    <li>9. What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</li>
    <ul><li>HTTP is the basic rulebook of how web browsers should transfer data between servers. HTTP sends data in plaintext whereas HTTPS sends data encrypted to protect it from interception.</li></ul>

    <li>10. Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</li>
    <ul><li>The Web went from Web 1.0s static, read only pages to Web 2.0s interactive, user generated social platforms like instagram, and now to Web 3.0s decentralized, AI powered searching, and personalized web. Each stage adds more user participation and intelligence, making the web more dynamic and connected to itself.</li></ul>

</ul>

<p>Questions 11-16:</p>
<ul>
    <li>11. Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</li>
    <ul><li>Web 1.0 was a static, read only web where users could only view content, Web 2.0 added interaction, user generated content, and social media. Web 3.0 adds on to this by adding decentralization, AI, and personalized, intelligent services for a smarter, more connected web.</li></ul>

    <li>12. Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</li>
    <ul><li>Markup languages like HTML use tags to create elements and display simple things to the browser which can be extended by using CSS along with HTML.</li></ul>

    <li>13. Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages.</li>
    <ul><li>Markup languages, like HTML, are used to structure and format content, defining how information is displayed. Scripting languages, like JavaScript, add logic and interactivity, allowing dynamic behavior and user interaction within applications.</li></ul>

    <li>14. Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</li>
    <ul><li>SGML is the original markup standard. XML is a more simple, strict subset for data. HTML is a web focused markup that's based off of SGML, while XHTML is HTML written to follow XML rules instead. DHTML combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactivity, and Markdown is a simple syntax that converts to HTML.</li></ul>

    <li>15. List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.</li>
    <ul><li>I like working with HTTP protocols and using things such as GET, POST, PUT etc. I enjoy making websites too as I just made a flashcard app for another assignment. I believe the web is very useful, and it is used for many things besides just web browsers.</li></ul>

    <li>16. Describe how CSE1210 may connect to your future occupational choices.</li>
    <ul><li>CSE1210 has taught me more about the HTTP / HTTPS protocols along with how to interact with HTML and CSS better. This is a skill I have gained and I can list it on my resume which could help encourage an employer to employ me.</li></ul>
